# Water-Potability-Prediction
This is a Classification model used to predict the potability of water based on its 'Ph', 'Hardness', 'Solids', 'Chloramines', 'Sulfate', 'Conductivity','Organic_carbon', 'Trihalomethanes', 'Turbidity'. This is a self-made project whose inspiration was taken from Kaggle.

## Data Collection 
The data source for this project was collected from kaggle.
Source of the data is: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability

## EDA
The data set had 3276 columns along with 10 columns. Among the 10 columns, 9 were independent features and 1 was the dependent feature. There was imbalance in the dataset having 1998 rows with data of impotable water samples and 1278 rows with data of potable water samples.
Upon further analyzing the data there were many insights i came across like:
1) The dataset had missing values.
2) Many feaures didn't had a normal disribution and has some kind of skewness in it, refering that the data set had OULIERS.
3) The data in the given data set is not scaled in the same order.
4) There was no coorelation among he feaures themselves nor with the target variable.
All these insights were gained by plotting graphs such as Boxplot, Histogram, Pairplot, Piechart, etc. and statistically analyzing the features.
